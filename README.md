# My dotfiles.

<!-- Here's my setup at the time of writing this:
* Machine: [VirtualBox 6.1](https://virtualbox.org/) virtual machine
* Linux Distro: [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) by System 76
* Window Manager: [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)
* Terminal: [GNOME Terminal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal/) (comes pre-installed with Pop!_OS) -->

<!-- I think I'll install Ubuntu on my ThinkBook 13s later. If all goes well, I'll think about moving to something like Arch or Manjaro. -->

* Currently using a **Lenovo ThinkBook 13s-IWL**
* I just installed Ubuntu 21.04 + i3wm
