Lucca's dot files. I'm a Linux noobie.

Here's my setup at the time of writing this:
* Machine: [VirtualBox 1.2](https://virtualbox.org/) virtual machine
* Linux Distro: [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) by System 76
* Window Manager: [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)

I think I'll install Ubuntu on my ThinkBook 13s later. If all goes well, I'll think about moving to something like Arch or Manjaro.
